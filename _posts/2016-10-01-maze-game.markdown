The [reddit dailyprogrammer community](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post a little coding-kata every day.
One challenge i did solve there was [Escpae the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4vrb8n/weekly_25_escape_the_trolls/).

You can find my code on [github](https://github.com/Horv87/MazeGame), some things i would like to add in the future are:

1. A random maze generator: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm).
2. Some trolls to make the game more fun.
3. Improved line of sight blocker.
